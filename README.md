# Cybersecurity Learning Portfolio

This repository documents my practical work and learning progress in cybersecurity. It is intended to demonstrate a developing body of technical skills, project experience, and the discipline that supports my academic and professional aspirations in the field of information security.

## Objective
To build a focused, verifiable portfolio that evidences my competence in cybersecurity fundamentals, with the long-term goal of pursuing higher education and a career in information security and computer science.

## Current Progress
- **Day 1 — Network Scanning & Packet Capture:** Nmap and Wireshark exercises demonstrating basic host discovery, port enumeration, and TCP handshake analysis. Files include raw scan output, packet captures, and a short technical report.
- **Day 2 — Open Source Intelligence (OSINT):** Reconnaissance exercises and documentation (in progress).

## What this repository contains
Each subfolder corresponds to a practical exercise and contains:
- raw data files (for example, Nmap output and PCAP captures);
- a concise technical report describing methodology, findings, and recommended follow-up actions; and
- supporting screenshots and notes used to validate the results.

## Methodology and Ethics
Work in this repository follows safe and ethical practices. All experiments are performed against authorized targets or controlled lab environments. Where public resources are used for learning, I adhere to applicable laws and responsible disclosure practices. Technical notes emphasise reproducibility and defensive remediation as well as offensive techniques, reflecting a balanced approach to security.

## Future Plans
As I continue building this portfolio, I plan to:
- expand my technical depth in penetration testing, network defense, and incident response;
- strengthen my foundations in computer science, mathematics, and applied cryptography;
- pursue contributions to open-source security projects and community knowledge sharing;
- document reflective insights on both technical growth and profession
